# Basic Components
## Nodes
## Net Device

- Network Devices transfer packets over channels 
- It incorporates Layer-1 (PHY) and Layer-2 (MAC)
- Devices interface with Layer-3 (Network)
- Layer-3 supports Layer-4 (Transport)
- Layer-4 is used by Layer-5
- Net Device are strongly bound to Channels of a matching type

# Key Abstractions

## Node:
- In ns-3 the basic computing device abstraction is called the node. 
- The Node class provides methods for managing the representations of computing devices in simulations.

## Application 
Examples: UdpEchoClientApplication, UdpEchoServerApplication

## Channel 
Examples: CsmaChannel(Ethernet-like), PointToPointChannel, WifiChannel
- A real Ethernet uses CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection) scheme with exponentially increasing backoff to contend for the shared transmission medium. The ns-3 CSMA device and channel models only a subset of this.

## NetDevice 
Examples: CsmaNetDevice, PointToPointNetDevice, WifiNetDevice
- Network devices (NICs) are controlled using network device drivers collectively known as net devices. 
- In Unix and Linux you refer to these net devices by names such as eth0. In ns-3 the net device abstraction covers both the software driver and the simulated hardware.
- The CsmaNetDevice is designed to work with a CsmaChannel; the PointToPointNetDevice is designed to work with a PointToPointChannel and a WifiNetNevice is designed to work with a WifiChannel.

## Topology Helpers:
- In a large simulated network you will need to arrange many connections between Nodes, NetDevices and Channels.
- Since connecting NetDevices to Nodes, NetDevices to Channels, assigning IP addresses, etc., are such common tasks in ns-3, we provide what we call topology helpers to make this as easy as possible.
- For example, it may take many distinct ns-3 core operations to create a NetDevice, add a MAC address, install that net device on a Node, configure the nodeâ€™s protocol stack, and then connect the NetDevice to a Channel. 
- Even more operations would be required to connect multiple devices onto multipoint channels and then to connect individual networks together into internetworks. 
- We provide topology helper objects that combine those many distinct operations into an easy to use model for your convenience.

# Collect information

## Logging

## Tracing

# Eaxamples

## Define variables

```cpp
std::string mode = "UseBridge";
uint16_t noEnbs = 1;
Time simTime = Seconds(600);
double distance = 60.0;
string pingTarget ("10.1.1.4");
Time interPacketInterval = MilliSeconds(100);
bool disablePl=false; 
```

## Command Line
```cpp
CommandLine cmd;
GlobalValue::Bind ("SimulatorImplementationType", StringValue ("ns3::RealtimeSimulatorImpl"));
cmd.AddValue("noEnbs","Number of eNodeBs", noEnbs);
cmd.AddValue ("simTime", "Total duration of the simulation", simTime);
cmd.Parse (argc,argv);
```

## Default configuration

```cpp
  Config::SetDefault ("ns3::LteSpectrumPhy::CtrlErrorModelEnabled", BooleanValue (false));
  Config::SetDefault ("ns3::RrFfMacScheduler::HarqEnabled", BooleanValue (false));
  ```
  
## Create host

```cpp
NodeContainer HostContainer;
HostContainer.Create(1);
Ptr<Node> Host = HostContainer.Get (0);
InternetStackHelper internet;
internet.Install (HostContainer);
```

## Connect two hosts

```cpp
PointToPointHelper p2ph;
p2ph.SetDeviceAttribute("DataRate", DataRateValue(DataRate("10Gb/s")));
p2ph.SetDeviceAttribute("Mtu",UintegerValue(1500));
p2ph.SetChannelAttribute("Delay",TimeValue(MilliSeconds(10)));
NetDeviceContainer internetDevices = p2ph.Install (Host0, Host1);
Ipv4AddressHelper ipv4h;
ipv4h.SetBase ("10.1.2.0", "255.255.255.0");
Ipv4InterfaceContainer internetIpIfaces = ipv4h.Assign(internetDevices);
Ipv4Address Host0Addr = internetIpIfaces.GetAddress(0);
Ipv4Address Host1Addr = internetIpIfaces.GetAddress(1);
```


## Get the routing table of remote Host

```cpp
Ipv4StaticRoutingHelper ipv4RoutingHelper;
Ptr<Ipv4StaticRouting> HostStaticRouting = ipv4RoutingHelper.GetStaticRouting (Host->GetObject<Ipv4>());
```

## Create ping application

```cpp
Ptr<V4Ping> app = CreateObject<V4Ping> ();
app->SetAttribute ("Remote", Ipv4AddressValue (externalUE));
app->SetAttribute ("Verbose", BooleanValue (true) );
remoteHost->AddApplication (app);
app->SetStartTime (Seconds (1.0));
app->SetStopTime (Seconds (120.0));
```
